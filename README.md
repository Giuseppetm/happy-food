    <b>Description of the project</b>
    <br><br>
    'Happy Food' is a web application for searching Tuscan restaurants,
    which allows users who use it <br>to find informations about restaurants in a particular city,
    and their location indicated on the map.<br>
    The only operation the user will have to do is to select the type
    of the category,<br> and the city of research. Once the appropriate button is pressed,<br>
    you will be able to see the list of restaurants, some information about them such <br>as the name,
    telephone number and address, and their location.
